# Swift

## Language Purpose/Genesis
#### Why was the language created?
Swift was created as a programming language to be used by developers on any of Apple's platforms including iOS, macOS, and many others.
#### What problems was the language trying to address?
Swift was made to address many of the common issues faced in programming. One of these issues was null pointers and crashes as a result of dereferencing them. Additionally, the language tries to simplify syntax by making it more intuitive and easy to read.
#### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Swift was a replacement for Objective-C which had been previously used by developers on Apple platforms.
